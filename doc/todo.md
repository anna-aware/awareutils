# TODO

- Fix import issues
- consider a `draw` modules which is `draw(shape, img)`.
- Now:
  - Add OpenCV dependency
- Admin:
  - flake8 config and generally nicer build stuff.
  - build pipeline in github.
- Performance:
  - Cythonize some of the shape stuff (coordinate checking etc.) to keep that fast.
  - Memoise calls like shape.center or shape.mask so if it's called a second time it's cached.
- Features:
  - Drawing:
    - Custom color classes? Again, BGR vs RGB. Maybe just use palletable so we get nice color palettes too.
    - Add shape drawing methods
      - `fill` and `border`
      - nicer text! add some cool fonts?
      - allow passing above color classes, or e.g. a single `255` means all pixels `255` etc.
      - Check contiguous if using OpenCV drawing to ensure arrays are drawn on inplace
  - Question: Pass through PIL/ndarray functionality to underlying image? E.g. allow `Img` to be indexed if source is array? Leaning towards 'no' as e.g. in this case user can just do `Img.bgr()` and then know it's an array (and this will also work if for some reason they change to using PIL `Img` instead).
  - OpenCV:
    - Automatically search USB devices if you don't know which number (as it's a bit weird) ...
    - Automatically search supported fourcc in videowriter (or does -1 do that?). At least find some good fourcc defaults.
  - Add fast video seeking to FileCapture.
  - Shape:
    - `shape.bounding_box` method
    - `shape.mask` method
  - Add v4l2 loopback videowriter
  - Using a 2d mask on a 3d image. Or maybe just have a `shape.mask3d()` method.
