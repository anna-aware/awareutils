# TODO

- tests!
- Add a pi camera class
- Push to pypi
- Build pipeline in github.
- Flake8 config and generally nicer build stuff.
- Drawing:
  - Transparency?
  - Add shape drawing methods
    - arrow? maybe a few other shapes.
    - nicer text! add some cool fonts?
- OpenCV:
  - Automatically search USB devices if you don't know which number (as it's a bit weird) ...
  - Automatically search supported fourcc in videowriter (or does -1 do that?). At least find some good fourcc defaults.
  - A nicer display GUI that wraps window creation, waitkey, etc.
- Add fast video seeking to FileCapture.
- Shape:
  - `shape.bounding_box` method
  - `shape.mask` method
- Add v4l2 loopback videowriter
- Using a 2d mask on a 3d image. Or maybe just have a `shape.mask3d()` method.
- Figure out nicer solution for circular imports
- Performance:
  - Cythonize some of the shape stuff (coordinate checking etc.) to keep that fast.
  - Memoise calls like shape.center or shape.mask so if it's called a second time it's cached.
