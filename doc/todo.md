# TODO

- CI/CD github
- Add a pi camera class
- If users never want to use pillow, allow that. likewise piexif, picamera, etc.
- maybe ImgSize -> ISize, ImgType -> IType, etc. Shorter code, easier to write, etc. Also - rect instead of rectangle.
- Admin:
  - flake8 config and generally nicer build stuff.
  - build pipeline in github.
- Performance:
  - Cythonize some of the shape stuff (coordinate checking etc.) to keep that fast.
  - Memoise calls like shape.center or shape.mask so if it's called a second time it's cached.
- Features:
  - Drawing:
    - Add shape drawing methods
      - circle. line. arrow? maybe a few other shapes.
      - nicer text! add some cool fonts?
  - OpenCV:
    - Automatically search USB devices if you don't know which number (as it's a bit weird) ...
    - Automatically search supported fourcc in videowriter (or does -1 do that?). At least find some good fourcc defaults.
  - Add fast video seeking to FileCapture.
  - Shape:
    - `shape.bounding_box` method
    - `shape.mask` method
  - Add v4l2 loopback videowriter
  - Using a 2d mask on a 3d image. Or maybe just have a `shape.mask3d()` method.
- Figure out nicer solution for circular imports
